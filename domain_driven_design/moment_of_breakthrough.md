Sometimes when the stage is set with model-driven-design and explicit concepts, you have a breakthrough. An oppurtunity opens up to tranform your software into something more expressive and versatile than you expected. 

[[deep_models]] can emerge gradually through a sequence of small refactorings one object at a time. Each such refinement in the code and model gives developers a clearer view which in turn creates the potential for a breakthrough of insights. 

### Focus on Basics
- Don't become paralyzed trying to bring about a breakthrough, it usually comes after many modes refactors
- Concentrate on knowledge crunching and cultivating robust [[ubiquitous_language]].
- Identify important domain concepts and make them explicit in the model.
- Refine the design to be suppler
- Distill the model
- Don't shy away from modest improvements
- Don't be paralyzed by looking to the future, just watch for the oppurtunity
